# APImon
A simple API REST for pokemons

## Pokeball design taken from [this](https://codepen.io/bad_printer/pen/Einpz) codepen

# Usage
It's quite simple, just clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the server!
```
git clone https://github.com/LucianoFromTrelew/APImon
cd APImon
npm i
npm start
```
The app will open up your default browser and display `index.html`, just click on the pokeball to get a random pokemon

---

The server will listen to port 3000. If you want to change the port, edit the `index.js` file on line 4
```
//change the port for the one you want
const port = 3000
```
